* Producing the tooling required for users to download and install onto their desktop / laptop machines, their own self-hosted 'solid based' read-write-social-web AI Platform.&#x20;
* Demonstrating how Semantic Web based technology ecosystems can be made to work; and,
  * Support the means for people to learn how these sorts of software design architectures operate differently to traditional 'web 2.0' apps.
* Provide a simplified environment that people can use to;
  * Communicate with one-another
  * Develop various forms of content
  * Develop (and share) 'apps'.
  * Produce, test, experiment and develop 'webizen' ecosystem parts.

The project will seek to achieve the following goals,

* The production of a 'human centric' contract law solution, that supports a means to radically improve how we manage the relationships between;&#x20;
